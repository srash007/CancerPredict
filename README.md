# CancerPredict
Dedicated to developing a machine learning model for predicting individuals at risk of developing cancer, leveraging hospital data for early detection and intervention. The project is inspired by a personal commitment to improving cancer diagnostics and prevention through data science.

## Current Focus :
#### Dataset Research: Identifying and exploring publicly available datasets related to cancer and medical history.
#### Learning Cancer Biology: Enhancing understanding of cancer biology and predictive indicators through literature and online courses.
#### Model Experimentation:
Implementing algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.
Testing feature selection and preprocessing techniques for improved predictions.
