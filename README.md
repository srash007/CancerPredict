# CancerPredict
Dedicated to developing a machine learning model for predicting individuals at risk of developing cancer, leveraging hospital data for early detection and intervention. The project is inspired by a personal commitment to improving cancer diagnostics and prevention through data science.

## Current Focus :
#### Dataset Research: Identifying and exploring publicly available datasets related to cancer and medical history.
#### Learning Cancer Biology: Enhancing understanding of cancer biology and predictive indicators through literature and online courses.
#### Model Experimentation:
Implementing algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.

Testing feature selection and preprocessing techniques for improved predictions.

## Project Workflow
### Data Collection and Preprocessing

Explore and clean datasets.

Handle missing values and perform data normalization.

### Feature Engineering
Analyze key variables influencing cancer risk.

Perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction.
### Model Development

Train and evaluate machine learning models.

Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
### Model Evaluation

Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
Ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.
